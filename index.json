As part of these assessments, you will be asked to upload documents to Blackboard, take tests via Blackboard, create videos and upload these into Blackboard, and upload documents to a Google Drive folder.\nCourse Membership Components in this category can take many forms including an introductory video you create/submit, weekly check-ins, active participation in the class, and reflections on your learning. In no way, however, will this component be a direct reflection of class attendance. One planned component is explained below.\nCheck-in: We are each being impacted by and dealing with the current Covid-19 crisis in different ways. Nearly every week I will ask you to submit a short response to a prompt on what you are doing to cope during these times. Each week will be slightly different with respect to what you are submitting, but you will typically provide some form of media (a single word, emoji, animated GIF, meme, image of a piece of art, song, etc.) and write a brief explanation for your selection.\nIn addition to doing weekly check-ins in this course, I have partnered with six other faculty from across campus to do similar check-ins within their courses. Responses from these courses will be combined and summarized. We will spend portions of class time discussing these responses from students around GVSU. To facilitate this, you will submit your responses in a Google Form (shared with you on Blackboard) that requires you to login with your GVSU network account. None of your personally identifiable information (e.g., name) will be shared with other students; however, your responses to these prompts will be viewable by other students. Additionally, students in some of these courses will use the combined, de-identified data for class projects.\nEach Check-in will be worth 1 point and your submission will be graded on whether your response is thoughtful, well-written, and shows engagement with the prompt. Notice that this is essentially a completion-based system. I am not grading your writing ability and I am not counting the exact number of words you are writing. I am looking for thoughtful engagement, that is all. Do good work and you will earn the point. If you prefer to not have your responses available to students outside of the class, contact your professor for an alternative assignment.\nIndividual Preparation Quizzes Each Learning Module will begin with completion of an Individual Preparation quiz. An Individual Preparation quiz will be administered via Blackboard and typically composed of approximately twelve questions (multiple-choice, short answer, etc.) based on the assigned Learning Module readings. An Individual Preparation score will be based on the number of correct answers. You will have up to three attempts for each Individual Preparation; the score from the last attempt completed prior to the submission deadline will be recorded as you grade. Each Individual Preparation will consist of randomly-generated items so one attempt will likely differ from the next.\nTeam Preparation Discussions Team Preparation discussions will be completed using the Discussion Board feature within the group space in Blackboard. Grading will be primarily based on timeliness of a response and whether the content of the response is substantive. For each Learning Module, you are required to start a discussion (by a specified deadline) and to add to at least one discussion (by another specified deadline) which were started by other team members. Each Team Preparation is worth up to four points (up to two points related to the starting of a discussion and up to two points related to the adding to a discussion started by a fellow team members).\nTeam Preparation contributions must be “substantive postings” (of both quality and reasonable length). For instance, when you add to a discussion topic, statements of simple agreement in response to a topic (i.e., “I agree” or “Good answer”) lack substantive content; your added comment should further the discussion of the prompt topic in a substantial way.\nApplication Quizzes During the semester, there will be (at least) 20 Application Quizzes. Typically, an Application Quiz is attached to an activity and will be administered as a test via Blackboard. Whereas Individual and Team Preparations can thought of as a Learning Module pre-test, an Application Quiz can be viewed as a post-test for an activity. An Application Quiz is designed as a way to assess your understanding of the ontent in an activity prior to attempting Homework. An Application Quiz will typically be assigned at the end of a class session and due 2 hours before the next class session.\nDespite their collective importance, the completion of an Application Quiz is optional. Application Quizzes are not part of the regular course points used to determine the base letter grade. However, the completion or non-completion of the Application Quiz can impact the final semester grade that is reported (see Grade Determination).\nHomework Ten homework assignments are planned. SAS-program-based homework will be uploaded into a shared Google folder. Homework involving interpretations and explanation will be completed as a “test” via Blackboard. Homework will be graded; however, not all assigned questions, in part or partial, may factor into the homework grade. Only the top eight homework scores will be used in determining course grades. The exact dates of a homework will be announced at least one week in advance.\nExams There will be five examinations – one corresponding to each Learning Module. The due date/time for the semester examinations will be announced at least a week in advance. An exam may include a portion completed via a Blackboard Test (multiple-choice, short answer, etc.) and a portion that involves submission of a video recording of yourself (both visual and auditory) explaining answers to provided prompts based on a scenario. You will have a window of time (typically at least 48 hours) in which complete and submit an examination. The portion of an exam completed as a Blackboard Test will be time limited. There will also be a maximum time limit imposed on any video portion of an exam. More details about the specifics of an exam, including when it is due, will be provided prior to each examination. You will upload any document used in guiding your completion of the video portion of an examination in Blackboard.\n","date":1610582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610582400,"objectID":"b64c2fa0906c861258368e3b03da0162","permalink":"https://stat216.github.io/courses/course-grading/assessments/","publishdate":"2021-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/course-grading/assessments/","section":"courses","summary":"Assessments will include Individual and Team Preparations, Quizzes, Homework, and Exams.

Students may not post or use the recordings in any other setting (e.g., social media) for any purpose. Students who violate this will be subject to student discipline, up to and including expulsion. If faculty have any plan to use the recording for a different class in the future, the faculty member will need written FERPA consent from those students in the current class who are identifiable in any of the recordings. A FERPA consent form signed by all students in the course will also be needed if the recordings are made available to others beyond the classroom on a non-secure digital platform.  Equitable and Inclusive Learning Environment I strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment in our class. It is my goal that you feel able to share information about your experiences as a student. I will keep information that you share with me private to the best of my ability; however, there is some information that may need to be shared with the university, especially regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred on GVSU’s campus. Below are additional resources available for support.\nTitle IX, Sexual Misconduct Policy, and Gender- and Sexual-Based Harassment Policy: Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, etc. Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition also protects students from discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity. If you or someone you know has been harassed, assaulted, or denied services on the basis of sex or gender, you can find the appropriate resources at https://www.gvsu.edu/titleix or contact the University’s Title IX Coordinator, Theresa Rowland at (616) 331-9530 or rowlanth@gvsu.edu.\nSpecial learning needs: If you have special needs because of learning, physical, or other disabilities, it is your responsibility to contact Disability Support Resources (DSR) at (616) 331-2490 or https://www.gvsu.edu/dsr. DSR will help you arrange accommodations. Then, set up an appointment with me about how I can help in making those accommodations and ensure that they are consistent with your arrangements with DSR.\nStudent Well-Being: As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can negatively impact your learning, such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal or sexual violence, difficulty eating or sleeping, loss/grief, and/or alcohol/drug problems. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance and affect your ability to participate in day-to-day activities. In order to support you during such challenging times, GVSU provides a number of confidential resources to all enrolled students, including the University Counseling Center https://www.gvsu.edu/counsel or (616) 331-3266 and the Student Ombuds, Takeelia Garrett garrettt@gvsu.edu.\nIf you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, I encourage you to visit Replenish, a food resource for GVSU students. GVSU also provides Special Circumstances and Financial Hardship grants that can be used to assist in paying for many expenses. Contact the Office of Financial Aid \u0026amp; Scholarships at (616) 331-3234 or visit Special Circumstance \u0026amp; Financial Hardship Requests.\nIf you are comfortable doing so, please speak with me about your circumstances so that I can advocate for you and connect you with other campus resources.\nGender expression and identity: If your state issued identification does not match your preferred name, your name can be updated in some areas (such as Blackboard, mailroom, and your GVSU ID). At GVSU, this is called “myName” and you can request a myName by following these steps:\n Login to myBanner, select the Personal Information tab, then select My Profile. You will be directed to another authentication page where you will be prompted to enter your network credentials. On the Personal Details section, select Edit on the and enter your myName.  When your myName has been received and reviewed, you will receive an email letting you know either that it has been approved or requesting further information. Once approved, allow up to two days for the myName to be updated across the campus system. More information about myName can be found on the Milton E. Ford LGBT Resource Center’s page.\nCOVID-19 As you are well aware, we will be having class this semester while trying to navigate a global pandemic that seems to change every day. Although these plans can be scary and demoralizing, I want you to know that GVSU is doing everything in its power to keep people safe from Covid-19. I believe that if we observe reasonable precautions like the ones described here, then while the risk of Covid-19 is still present, there is no reason to be afraid. We will still learn and grow intellectually just as in “typical” times if we stay focused and work together.\nWhat follow are general guidelines for how we can work productively together during STA 216.\nTaking care of yourself Of the utmost importance is taking care of your own physical and mental health during these difficult times. Make sure you are getting sufficient rest, staying connected to friends and family, and giving yourself time and space to do things you enjoy outside of college. The Mayo Clinic provides several tips for maintaining good self-care in our situation.\nWhile we will not be coming to campus for STA 216, you are still implored to perform a self-evaluation each day and if you feel even the slightest bit of sickness or Covid-19 symptoms, stay home. If you have a class that meets on campus, you should be on campus only if you feel completely healthy.\nContingency plans for the semester We will be “synchronously online” for the semester, but several things could happen that might alter this setup. Here are the initial plans for the most likely of those things.\nIf the professor is in self-quarantine, but not because of illness:\nFor example, if my partner becomes sick or if my daily self-assessment directs me to stay at home. In this case, we will continue synchronous online meetings and an asynchronous option might be introduced.\nIf the professor has a Covid-19 infection:\nThe entire course will be moved to an asynchronous online format until I am well enough to resume my responsibilities. A substitute instructor may be appointed to grade and give feedback on Preparation and Follow-up tasks and all other graded work will be suspended until I am well enough to grade.\nIn either of these two cases, you can expect a slowdown in the grading process and substantial changes to the course calendar or syllabus. Please monitor your course announcements daily to ensure you have correct information. Note that these plans may be changed or overridden by university-wide directives as the semester unfolds. Again, the course announcements will be where I post any information.\nGVSU Policies This course is subject to GVSU\u0026rsquo;s Course Policies.\nChanges to this Syllabus Changes to this syllabus may occur during the semester. These changes will be announced in class and online, and if appropriate, students will be given an opportunity to voice on how the changes will be implemented.\nKey Semester Dates Important dates to keep in mind for this semester are available at the Registrar\u0026rsquo;s Academic Calendar. I highlight a few here.\n Classes Begin: Tuesday, January 19  Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday observed Monday, January 18   Winter Break: Wednesday, March 10 Winter Break: Thursday, April 1 Drop Deadline (Grade of “W”): Friday, April 9, 5 p.m. Classes End: Saturday, April 24 Final Examination Week: Monday, April 26 – Saturday, May 1  ","date":1610582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610582400,"objectID":"183fd45c101836b842654216fb541350","permalink":"https://stat216.github.io/courses/course-policies/policies/","publishdate":"2021-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/course-policies/policies/","section":"courses","summary":"Academic Integrity The university’s academic integrity policy is described in the GVSU Student Code, Section 4.

Most in-class time will be spent working on activities that allow you to directly apply key course concepts within the classroom. These activities will be shared with you on Blackboard as Google Docs.\nThe course is divided into five Learning Modules. Each Learning Module has three components: Preparation, Application, and Assessment.\nPreparation How we prepare for our class sessions is essential for Team-Based Learning. Each Preparation provides an opportunity to demonstrate your comprehension of the reading and course concepts. Each Preparation follows the sequential pattern:\n Readings: At the start of each Learning Module, you will complete assigned readings outside of class (which may also include watching videos). These readings contain the core concepts and ideas needed to be successful in the Application phase. There will be additional readings as you and your team members progress through the activities within a Learning Module. Individual Preparation Quiz: Each Individual Preparation quiz is a short (12-ish) set of questions composed of multiple-choice and short answer items. These questions will focus on the core concepts and ideas from the readings. The Individual Preparation will be administered via Blackboard as Tests and will be scored on the number of correct answers. You are allowed up to three attempts for each Individual Preparation; the score from your last attempt prior to the submission deadline will be recorded as your Individual Preparation grade. Each Individual Preparation will consist of randomly-generated items so one attempt will likely differ from the next. Team Preparation Discussion: After the deadline for completing an Individual Preparation has passed, you and your team members will complete a Team Preparation discussion for each Learning Module. Team Preparations will be administered via Blackboard using the Discussion Board feature within the Team group space. A Team Preparation for a Learning Module will consist of at least five open-ended questions. Each team member will select one question and provide an initial response, by the specified deadline, to lead-off the discussion thread. Then, each team member must add to at least one existing thread by a specified deadline. A Team Preparation score will be based on two components: the thread started and the combination of threads added to. Each component will be assessed on a completion-based system and and on-task substance (and less so on the \u0026ldquo;correctness\u0026rdquo; of a response). Clarifying Discussion: On occasion, a short lecture may be provided to clarify points of confusion which surface from an Individual Preparation quiz or Team Preparation discussion or to \u0026ldquo;set the stage\u0026rdquo; for an upcoming activity. I addition to these occurring at the discretion of the professor, there will be a Community discussion board on Blackboard where students can post items they wish further clarification on. Post on this Community discussion will be viewable by all students and questions emailed to the professor may be instructed to instead be posted here so that the response is available to all students. Other students are strongly encouraged to participate in posts made in the Community discussion area.  Both Individual and Team Preparation tasks are designed for you demonstrate baseline knowledge of a Learning Module prior to starting the activities. My intent is to always start a new Learning Module on the first day of class within a week (i.e. either a Monday or a Tuesday, depending on the section). Doing so should provide you with ample time from the last prior class in which to complete both the Individual and Team Preparation tasks prior to starting activities.\nBy at least the end of the last class session in the week prior to the start of a new Learning Module:\n Readings for new Individual Preparation announced Individual Preparation available in Blackboard Team Preparation questions made available (team members should negotiate who will post starting response to which Team Preparation question) First activity for new Learning Module is made available (along with solutions)  By 48 hours prior to the next class session:\n Deadline for completing Individual Preparation Deadline for posting start of discussion thread for a Team Preparation question  By start of the next class session:\n Deadline for adding to at least one discussion thread started by another team member  During the next class session:\n In-class discussion related to first activity for new Learning Module  We will spend a time during the first class session discussing these details specific to your section. At any point during the semester where you are confused about this process, please ask.\nApplication The Preparation portion of a Learning Module is to assure individual accountability to the team. After the Preparation portion is completed, we move into the Application portion. Much of the learning in a Team-Based Learning course occurs through working on a series of activities. The activities require you and your team members to apply concepts from the course readings to a series of scenario-based questions which allow you to demonstrate knowledge of one or more of the course goals.\nThe number of activities within a Learning Module will vary between three and five. Each activity is composed of a series of questions (multiple-choice, calculation-based , short-answer, explanation, etc.) about a course component (i.e., statistical technique). The Applications for a Learning Module will follow this order:\n The first activity will be made available via Blackboard as a Google Doc the class session following the due date of the Individual Preparation quiz. During this first class session, you and your team members will work together answering the activity questions. There are planned check points throughout these activities at which point you will contact your professor to have them check your answers and provide clarifying discussion on items you got wrong (or you are not sure why you got an item right!). Your professor will also be cycling through team breakout rooms to be available for intermediate clarification. Usually after this class session, the full activity solutions will be made available. If your team does not complete an activity in class, you will need to do so prior to the next class session. If you get an item wrong:  Recheck the readings to see why the indicated answer is correct, Discuss any items of interest among your team members, Make note of any items you would like to bring up for discussion during the next class session by adding it to the Class Agenda forum (in the Community discussion area).   There will be a short (3-6 questions) Application quiz after each activity for you to check your current understanding. The next class session will begin discussing any items of interest raised by students (which may involve a full-class discussion). The next activity and corresponding readings will become available prior to the the next class session and the process is repeated until all activities associated with a Learning Module have been completed.  The more advance time you spend preparing for a Learning Module (i.e., doing the readings), the more prepared you should be to complete the activities.\nNote that activities are not collected and not graded. The activities are designed for you to check your understanding of the statistical content within STA 216.\nAssessment Each Learning Module includes 1) a graded homework assignment that may include producing and interpreting SAS output, doing hand calculations, and providing interpretations; and 2) an exam. Additional information is provided at Course Grading.\n","date":1610582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610582400,"objectID":"6d5ec4462b6422ae3cce7511f31b63a2","permalink":"https://stat216.github.io/courses/course-structure/team-based-learning/","publishdate":"2021-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/course-structure/team-based-learning/","section":"courses","summary":"This course will be taught using a Team-Based Learning approach which encourages collaboration and active learning for both individuals and teams.
